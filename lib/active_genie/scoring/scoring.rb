      SCORING_PROMPT = <<~PROMPT
      Evaluate and score the provided text based on predefined criteria, which may include rules, keywords, or patterns. Use a scoring range of 0 to 100, with 100 representing the highest possible score. Follow the instructions below to ensure an accurate and objective assessment.

      # Evaluation Process
      1. **Analysis**: Thoroughly compare the text against each criterion to ensure comprehensive evaluation.
      2. **Document Deviations**: Clearly identify and document any areas where the content does not align with the specified criteria.
      3. **Highlight Strengths**: Emphasize notable features or elements that enhance the overall quality or effectiveness of the content.
      4. **Identify Weaknesses**: Specify areas where the content fails to meet the criteria or where improvements could be made.

      # Output Requirements
      Provide a detailed review, including:
        - A final score (0-100)
        - Specific reasoning for the assigned score, covering all evaluated criteria.
        - Ensure the reasoning includes both positive aspects and suggested improvements.

      # Guidelines
      - Maintain objectivity, avoiding biases or preconceived notions.
      - Deconstruct each criterion into actionable components for a systematic evaluation.
      - If the text lacks information, apply reasonable judgment to assign a score while clearly explaining the rationale.
